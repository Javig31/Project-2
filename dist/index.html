				<h3 class="card-title">Raul Bocanegra</h3>
				<p class="card-text">
				Raul Bocanegra was elected to represent the 39th District in the California State Assembly. The district includes the communities of Agua Dulce, Canyon Country, Newhall, Santa Clarita, the Los Angeles communities of Arleta, Granada Hills, Lakeview Terrace, Mission Hills, North Hollywood, Pacoima, Shadow Hills, Sun Valley, Sunland-Tujunga, Sylmar, and the City of San Fernando.</p>

				<p>Raul was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley and attended local schools in the 39th Assembly District.  After earning his Master’s Degree in Urban Planning at UCLA, he went to work as a top aide for then-Los Angeles City Councilmember Alex Padilla, and championed job creation efforts, and much needed economic investments to the northeast San Fernando Valley.  Raul would go onto to help establish the San Fernando Valley Financial Development and the Pacoima Development Federal Credit Union, which have brought in over $100 million in additional investments and new economic opportunities for the region.</p>

				<p>During his first term in the Assembly, Raul worked in a bipartisan fashion to successfully pass legislation that addressed key issues, such as increasing the minimum wage, removing barriers to accessing affordable healthcare for women and working families, and revamping public schools with programs that give students the skills they need to success in today’s workforce.</p>

				<p>Raul also chaired the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee and was tasked with making financial decisions that would greatly impact citizens of California.  He used this position to help balance our state’s budget, cracking down on those cheating the tax code, and protecting critical programs from future recessions through creation of the State’s Rainy Day Savings Fund.  Raul played a key role in the leadership team that passed a budget that was on-time and with a surplus in more than a decade.</p>

				<p>One of Raul’s signature pieces of legislation was AB 1839, the California Film and Television Job Retention Act, which is estimated to have generated over $4 billion in economic growth and brought thousands of jobs back to California.  He also audited the Los Angeles Department Water & Power over their troubled computer billing system.</p>

				<p>Raul understands that direct community outreach at the local level is critical for positive change. He helped establish neighborhood “block clubs” to improve public safety, and used his Urban Planning background to teach students at UCLA, CSU Long Beach, and CSU Northridge in their nationally-renowned Urban Studies and Planning Department.</p>

				<p class="card-text">
				Bob Hertzberg is the first former Assembly Speaker in 86 years to be elected to the California State Senate, and one of only six lawmakers in California history to serve as Assembly Speaker and subsequently win a seat in the Senate.</p>
				<p>What makes his political journey even more remarkable is that his two stints in the Legislature were separated by a dozen years of public policy activism as a private citizen, lawyer and businessman.</p>
				<p>Now representing nearly 1 million residents of the San Fernando Valley in the Senate, Hertzberg remains committed to looking at the big challenges facing California. In the words of one veteran Sacramento columnist, he is “an intense bundle of energy, an all-night negotiator.”</p>
				<p>A native of Los Angeles, Hertzberg grew up in a household where elders encouraged the children to share their views. His father, Harrison, was a lawyer and his mother, Antoinette “Bunny,” raised her five sons to think for themselves.</p>
				<p>The best notions were the ones that challenged convention. Around the dinner table, the family exchanged a steady stream of ideas meant to provoke creative thinking.</p>
				<p>After graduating from Palm Springs High, Hertzberg enrolled at the University of Redlands, where he pursued a double major in History and English. He wrote a 400-page handbook titled “A Commonsense Approach to English” and graduated Magna Cum Laude.</p>
				<p>As an undergraduate student, he caught the bug of politics and served as a volunteer in a number of campaigns in south and east Los Angeles. He organized fellow students on behalf of Mervyn Dymally’s historic run for lieutenant governor in 1974. Hertzberg drove Dymally to each and every one of California’s 58 counties. The campaign ended with Dymally’s election as California’s first African-American lieutenant governor.</p>

				Alex Padilla was sworn in as California Secretary of State on January 5, 2015. He is committed to modernizing the office, increasing voter registration and participation, and strengthening voting rights.</p>

				<p>Padilla previously served in the California State Senate (2006-2014) where he chaired the Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Communications. As chair, he shepherded legislation to combat climate change and create a greener and more sustainable economy.  He pursued an ambitious agenda in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency, smart grid, and broadband deployment.</p>

				<p>Padilla's parents emigrated from Mexico and raised their family in the working class community of Pacoima, California.  His father worked as a short order cook and his mother cleaned houses.  Padilla attended local public schools and went on to graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.  He recently completed a five-year term as a member of the MIT Corporation (Board of Trustees).  Padilla is often asked how he moved from engineering to public service. He explains that in many ways they are similar; the goal of each is solving problems.</p>

				<p>After working for Hughes Aircraft in Southern California, Padilla participated in the Coro Fellows Program where he received leadership and public affairs training.  He would later work for U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-Assemblymember Tony Cardenas.</p>

				<h3 class="card-title">Jerry Brown</h3>
				<p class="card-text">
				Edmund G. Brown Jr. was born in San Francisco on April 7, 1938. He graduated from St. Ignatius High School in 1955 and entered Sacred Heart Novitiate, a Jesuit seminary. He later attended the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1961 before earning a J.D. at Yale Law School in 1964.</p>

				<p>Brown was elected Trustee for the Los Angeles Community College District in 1969, Secretary of State in 1970 and Governor in 1974 and 1978. As Governor, he helped create millions of jobs, strengthened environmental protections and promoted renewable energy. After his governorship, Brown lectured and traveled widely, practiced law, served as chairman of the state Democratic Party and ran for president.</p>

				<p>In 1998, Brown was elected Mayor of Oakland and helped revitalize its downtown and reduce crime, while also founding two high-performing charter schools. Brown was elected California Attorney General in 2006 and worked to protect consumers, pursue mortgage fraud and real estate scams, champion workers' rights and crack down on violent crime.</p>

				<p>Brown was elected to a third gubernatorial term in 2010 and to a historic fourth term in 2014. Since returning to the Governor's Office, Brown helped eliminate the state's multi-billion budget deficit, spearheading successful campaigns to provide billions in new funding for California's schools (Proposition 30) and establish a robust Rainy Day Fund to prepare for the next economic downturn (Proposition 2).</p>

				<p>Under Brown, California has cut its unemployment rate in half, expanded health coverage to millions more Californians, and added more than 2 million new jobs, while enacting sweeping public safety, immigration, workers' compensation, water, pension and economic development reforms. California has also established nation-leading targets to protect the environment and fight climate change, and by 2030 the state will: reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels, generate half of its electricity from renewable sources, double the rate of energy efficiency savings in its buildings and reduce today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent.<p>

				<p>Brown is married to Anne Gust Brown, who serves as Special Counsel, an unpaid position, in the Office of the Governor.</p>

				<h3 class="card-title">Tony Cardenas</h3>
				<p class="card-text">
				Raised by hard-working immigrant parents, Tony Cárdenas was brought up with simple ideals – that integrity and dedication were the keys to success. These are the qualities that he has brought to his career as a public servant, and he continues to offer that today as a United States Congressman.</p>
				<p>Rep. Cárdenas was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2013 for the 113th Congress (2013-2014) and has represented California’s 29th district since. Now in the 114th Congress (2015-2016), Rep. Cárdenas sits on the prestigious House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which he was elected to in his first term. The Committee on Energy and Commerce is the oldest of the "authorizing" committees in the House. In addition to being a member of Congress’s most established committee, Rep. Cárdenas is a member of House Democratic Leadership, working with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer as an Assistant Whip.</p>
				<p>While only serving in Congress for two terms, Rep. Cárdenas has committed to bringing awareness and change to the issues most important to the San Fernando Valley and its families. He has been recognized locally and nationally for his stance on common sense gun reform, juvenile justice, and championing solutions that will make the U.S. economy even stronger to bring better-paying jobs to the American people</p>

				<p class="card-text">
				As California's senior Senator, Dianne Feinstein has built a reputation as an independent voice, working with both Democrats and Republicans to find commonsense solutions to the problems facing California and the nation.</p>
				<p>Since her election to the Senate in 1992, Senator Feinstein has worked in a bipartisan way to build a significant record of legislative accomplishments, helping strengthen the nation's security at home and abroad, combat crime and violence, battle cancer and protect natural resources in California and across the country.</p>
				<p>In 2009, Senator Feinstein assumed chairmanship of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where she oversaw the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies. She was the first female Senator to hold that position. As chairman, Feinstein oversaw the passage of six intelligence authorization bills following a five-year drought. The committee also approved a key bipartisan report on the Benghazi attacks and released key information about the CIA's detention and interrogation program following a six-year review. Today, Senator Feinstein serves as vice chairman of the committee, during which time the committee passed the first significant congressional legislation to address security flaws in our nation's cybersecurity.</p>
				<p>Senator Feinstein is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee where she is ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy and Water. She is also a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which she chaired during the 110th Congress. In that capacity, Senator Feinstein was the first woman to chair the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and presided over the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009.</p>
